Character Classification using HOG and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This repository contains the source code for a character classification project developed as part of the Computer Vision course (RE604).

The project employs Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize handwritten alphabet characters from the EMNIST Letters dataset.
